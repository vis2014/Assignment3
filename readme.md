###3. Analysis of the Visualization
+ The added value of the tertiary industry is composed of six parts, which are hotels and catering services, the real estate, transportation storage, finance, wholesale and retail and the others. The chart tells us the added value and its proportion of each part of the tertiary industry from 1989 to 2013. They are all connected.
+ When the mouse points at any part of the tertiary industry, it will shows us the added value in each year from 1989 to 2013 in a special color.
+ What’s more, if we want to know the details of the added value of some year, all we need is to move our mouse to this year. For instance, when the mouse points to the year of 2000, we can get the added values of all the six parts and their proportion. In the year of 2000, the hotels and catering services contributed least to the tertiary industry, followed by the finance.
