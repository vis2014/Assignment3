###Brief
This is about the vehicle information visualization. We draw a multivariate data visualization with the D3 tool.

###Data Source
The data comes from datatang.The link of data:http://www.datatang.com/data/46763

###Data Processing
The data from datatang is .exle format.I saved it as .csv format so that it can be used derictly by webstorm.We select a part of the data because the figure will be too narrow to be seen clearly if there are too much tuples.Vehicle attributes include name(type型号),displacement(排量),power(功率),weight(重量),length(车长) and yield(年产量).

###Design
![alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Title")


###Illustration&&Findings
*The first picture is the overall picture showed directly when the Webpage is opened.As we can see,there are six vertical axis which separately on behalf of name(type型号),displacement(排量),power(功率),weight(重量),length(车长) and yield(年产量).A broken line corresponds to the data of a type of vehicle.We can easily see the bottom line is very dense.Those lines  correspond to vehicles with small displacement, low power, light weight and short length.So we can obtain a conclusion that people like this kind of vehicle so there are more vehicle type in this kind.
*The four pictures after are about the information corresponds to a range of data of an selected attribute.For example,in the secend picture,I selected displacement and made the range from 8 to 10,and then,there were several broken lines became yellow,and the name corresponded became blue.In this way,we can easily search the data we what and find the information of same or similar vehicles in some certain aspects.
*In the fourth picture,the yield of high power are very low,and the  value of displacement,weight and length are also small.Combined with the first paragraph,we can draw a conclusion that most people buy a light car instead of heavy vehicle.So the manufacturers should try to produce more kinds of cars to adapt to the needs of the public.

###Proportion
*A2:50%
*A3:50%
